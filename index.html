                </p>
                <p>First Page consists of three pages: index, another page, and a form.</p>
                <p>This exercise was modified from its original parameters to consist of four panels instead of three pages. The panels use in-page anchors for navigation. This alteration was made to keep the exercise to a single page.</p>

                <p>Live in the Wild is a gallery featuring wild animals in a flexible layout.</p>
                <p>This exercise was expanded upon to include the gallery images as a background to the menu bar and for each image to show a caption when hovered upon.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Android Journeys was originally an exercise in creating the android, or robot, using only css. On hover, it included the animations of an expanding head and a leg at an angle.</p>
                <p>The animation of expanding the head was removed and the exercise was expanded into a gallery of scenes, where the robot changes color and size according to the image background. Javascript was used to keep track of images, their credit and sources, the color and size of the android.</p>
