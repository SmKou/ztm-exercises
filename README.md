Personal solutions to ZeroToMastery exercises (except basic exercises)

## 1. First Page
**Level:** Beginner
**Concept:** Basic elements of HTML
**Contains:** HTML, CSS

First Page consists of three pages: index, another page, and a form.

This exercise was modified from its original parameters to consist of four panels instead of three pages. The panels use in-page anchors for navigation. This alteration was made to keep the exercise to a single page.

## 2. Live in the Wild
**Level:** Beginner
**Concept:** Use of Flexbox
**Contains:** HTML, CSS

Live in the Wild is a gallery featuring wild animals in a flexible layout.

This exercise was expanded upon to include the gallery images as a background to the menu bar and for each image to show a caption when hovered upon.
